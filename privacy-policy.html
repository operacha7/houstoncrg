      <h1>Community Resources Guide Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Effective Date: January 8, 2025</h2>

      <p>
        The Community Resources Guide is committed to protecting your privacy.
        Below is an explanation of how we handle information within the
        application.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
      <p>
        The Community Resources Guide does not collect, store, or share any
        personal data about clients. It serves as a repository of publicly
        available information about organizations that provide financial and
        other assistance in the Greater Houston Area. The application stores
        organization email addresses provided by the organizations themselves.
        These addresses are used solely to generate a customized email signature
        for the organization when sending emails to clients. Organizations may
        update or remove their email addresses from the database at any time by
        contacting the developer.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Data Usage</h3>
      <p>
        The application uses limited access to each organization’s Google Sheets
        to display resource information. It does not access or use any other
        part of the organization’s Google account. All data is used solely for
        its intended purpose: connecting individuals and organizations with
        resources. The application does not share, sell, or use this data for
        any other purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Third-Party Data</h3>
      <p>
        The Community Resources Guide does not maintain or handle client
        information, such as client email addresses. Any client information is
        managed directly by the referring organizations, and their respective
        privacy policies apply.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The email addresses stored in the application are protected with
        appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.
        Access to the Google Sheet that stores these email addresses is
        restricted solely to the developer, Omar Peracha. No other individual or
        entity has access to this data.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Contact Information</h3>
      <p>
        For questions about this privacy policy or other policies related to the
        application, please contact the developer: <b>Omar Peracha</b><br />
        Email: operacha@gmail.com
      </p>

      <p>
        A summary of this privacy policy and other Terms & Conditions are
        available directly within the application.
